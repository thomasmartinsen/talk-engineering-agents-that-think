# Engineering agents that Think, Act, and Govern themselves

The AI landscape is shifting from passive copilots to fully autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks independently. This transformation unlocks new possibilities—but also introduces security, governance, and ethical challenges that demand new architectural thinking.

This session will dive deep into the design and operational concerns of autonomous AI agents, exploring how they can be built to act responsibly, self-improve, and remain controllable. We'll walk through multi-agent architectures and self-correcting mechanisms.
